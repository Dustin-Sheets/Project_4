# CardioGuard: Intelligent Analytics for Heart Disease Prevention

## Project Overview:
Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Our project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive analytics model for early heart disease detection. By analyzing patient data, we aim to build a system that predicts the likelihood of a person developing heart disease.

### Datasets, APIs, and Libraries:

**Datasets**
- Using a "heart disease health indicator" dataset, we analyzed the following 22 columns and how each could be an indicator of being at risk of suffering heart disease.

- We determined that the columns `GenHlth`,`MentHlth`,`PhysHlth`,`Income`, and `Education` were not an at risk factor and were therefore dropped.
- The following columns were used when compailing, training, and evaluating the machine learning model used to predict heart disease risk.

## Results

## Limitations
- Our model does not take into account all social factors that could affect a person's stroke risk. We excluded income and education, but it iis important to note that people with better access to education have the opportunity to earn more income. More income can possibly mean better access to quality healthcare. 

## Conclusion
- Heart diseas is the leading cause of death in the United States and has multiple risk factors. The most common of which are:
  - Hypertension
  - Obesity
  - Diabetes
  - High Total Cholesterol
- It is also important to notice how different races and ethnicities are affected heart disease.
  - Non-Hispanic blacks adults are more likely to die from heart disease and 59% suffer from hypertension.
  - Hispanics, Blacks, Asian adults are more likely than white adults to develop diabetes.
  - Hispanics are also twice as likely to have undiagnosed diabetis.
