# CardioGuard: Intelligent Analytics for Heart Disease Prevention

## Project Overview:
Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Our project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive analytics model for early heart disease detection. By analyzing patient data, we aim to build a system that predicts the likelihood of a person developing heart disease.

### Datasets, APIs, and Libraries:

**Datasets**
- Using a "heart disease health indicator" dataset, we analyzed the following 22 columns and how each could be an indicator of being at risk of suffering heart disease.

- We determined that the columns `GenHlth`,`MentHlth`,`PhysHlth`,`Income`, and `Education` were not an at risk factor and were therefore dropped.
- The following columns were used when compailing, training, and evaluating the machine learning model used to predict heart disease risk.

## Results

## Limitations

## Conclusion
- Heart diseas is the leading cause of death in the United States and has multiple risk factors. The most common of which are:
  - Hypertension
  - Obesity
  - Diabetes
  - High Total Cholesterol
- It is also important to notice how different races and ethnicities are affected heart disease.
  - Non-Hispanic blacks adults are more likely to die from heart disease.
